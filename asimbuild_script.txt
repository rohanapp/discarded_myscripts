Sample Unified/ASim/AFD nightly silent install bat file content:
Note that this bat file assumes that you have wget installed and in the system path.  Please replace the items in {curly braces} such as the usernames and passwords.  The encrypted password can be generated from the Artifactory page by clicking on your username in the upper-right-hand-corner of the page.  Type your password and hit Unlock.  Copy the password and replace the password fields in the bat file.
Also, update the installer download location and install location as this example uses the following paths:
•	Download location: F:\wb2_work\14.5\installer
•	Install Location: D:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc
** Note that it is more efficient in terms of installation time to have the installer download to a separate drive than the install location.  This example uses F: for installer download and the D drive for the actual installation.
